o Notification that Berlin has fallen, was occurring on round 24 in MID timeline in addition to the correct time at round 30.
o Japan was not receiving ArmamentX on round 24 in MID timeline due to a 'when' overlap on signal unit placement.
o Round 18 event was not firing because a condition was requiring United States to own Japan instead of United States. 
o Solved a persistent bug: 4 notifications and 2 triggers were set to fire before "JapanesePlacement".  The correct delegate was "japanesePlace".
  This bug was introduced several versions ago, to prevent German units from being un-moveable to the player the round they spawn.  Sloppily, the
  delegate name got entered incorrectly.  Now, German units spawn and notifications related to German progression are firing properly.

o 5 American destroyers now enter the Panama Canal when Japan takes Western USA. (to slightly offset advantage of early USA full blitz strategy)
o Added 2 supplies to USA counter-attack.
o One of the two conditions to receive MID or HI timelines changed.  Japan must now control 16 Asian territories, including the Soviet Union.
o Americans receive 3, 2, or 1 extra tech tokens on even rounds 20-30 in LO, MID, or HI timelines, respectively.
o German transport movement increased from 2 to 3.  German transport capacity increased from 10 to 11. - Makes each German unit unique, fleet can now move as a stack.

o China receives -7 PUs/round always.  China receives warbanners instead of wartime income.  China no longer receives any automatic bonus units except as listed below.
o NEW CHINESE WARBANNER PRODUCTION BONUS SYSTEM:  Once per Chinese territory taken by Japan, each adjacent territory has a 50% chance of spawning a warbanner which 
  autoproduces one infantry every round.  Tsinghai and Szechwan receive an infantry instead of a chance for a warbanner.  When Tsinghai falls, one infantry spawns in 
  adjacent territories instead.  When Szechwan falls every Chinese territory receives one infantry instead, two in hardmode. (done for strategic flexibility and variety)
o Szechwan, while Chinese,  produces an infantry and an artillery each turn any other Chinese territory is under Japanese control.
